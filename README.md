**Executive Summary**

I am a dedicated learner and honest professional with high level of integrity and enthusiasm. I have worked in teams and performed solely as well. I have served the academia of Pakistan and strived for institutional collaborations of business and management schools to bring coopetition and to promote research culture in the region. That includes initiatives for supporting, standardizing and strengthening business and management education through collaborative efforts in a cooperative environment. I have also worked as lecturer of management, strategy and business. I have authored several research papers, published in internationally renowned journals. My knowledge of qualitative and quantitative research tools includes NVIVO, SPSS and R software packages. I am keenly interested in cooperation challenges, integrity and growth of organisations, ecosystems and associations for shared goals. Also, I am a great proponent of women literacy, empowerment, and right to work, and consider inclusivity crucial for socio-economic development.
